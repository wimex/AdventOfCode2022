## ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022
It's that time of the year again! Random solutions to the Advent of Code challenge (https://adventofcode.com).
This year, it's in ... (rolls dice) ... RUBY!

## ðŸŽ¬ To get started
You'll need `Ruby >= 3.1`. The easiest way to setup the environment is to use `asdf`, the `.tool-versions` file will select the preferred version automatically.

After cloning the repository, enter into the solutions directory and type `ruby dayXX.rb` to print the answer for the questions. If you want to run the code on a different input, replace the relevant files in the `inputs` directory.

The input paths are relative and hardcoded into the source.
